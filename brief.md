Flightr

A new start-up Flightr, has spotted a niche in the Flight + Hotel comparison web app market. It realises it can simultaneously compare flights and hotels to offer the best package possible.

It wants a user to be able to reach our web app and input a departure date and return date and then display possible flight + hotel options. Once searched, it would calculate the available options of flights and represent the data analytically to show travel times or perhaps best value options. It will also display hotel options nearby and a total package price for return flights and hotel nights based on the user input.

They would like the MVP built as soon as possible along with any other features you can implement.

MVP
User can search by departure and return dates
